# Documentation
- Document modules in their own READMEs.
- Document code inline:
  - **Why** we do something the way we do it (if it is not obvious).
  - What something does **only** if it improves readability.
  - Never document what's obvious from the code.
  - Good code documents itself.
- Update the main README.md when needed.
