# How to Make Changes (Agent Playbook)
When working on an issue:
1. Identify whether it is Drupal-side, frontend-side, or integration.
2. Create the smallest change that fixes it.
3. Add or update tests.
4. Ensure config/export steps (Drupal) are done if needed.
5. Update docs if behavior/setup changed.
