# Working agreements
- Do not introduce new frameworks unless explicitly required.
- If required, explain advantages and disadvantages and explicityl ask for confirmation.
- Do not refactor unrelated areas (keep diffs tight).
- If you change behavior, add/adjust tests.
- Prefer incremental improvements over large rewrites.
- Never commit secrets. Never log secrets.
- Before you commit/stage anything, *ALWAYS* let me review it; pause while I'm doing so.
